The framework comes with a GUI mod manager - you're looking at it. It is capable of managing deploy order, importing RPKG and framework.zip mods and helping in the creation of your own mods.

## Framework ZIP files
A framework ZIP file is extracted directly to the `Mods` folder. For example, if you are packaging `MyAmazingMod`:
```
MyAmazingMod/
├─ manifest.json
├─ content folder/
│  ├─ chunk0/
│  │  ├─ Vamprism.contract.json
│  │  ├─ 0098B17A37DE.GFXF
│  │  ├─ GlobalDataPatch.entity.patch.json
│  ├─ chunk1/
│  │  ├─ ...
├─ blobs folder/
│  ├─ images/
│  │  ├─ unlockables/
│  │  │  ├─ theBestUnlockable.jpg
```
then your folder structure for the framework.zip file should look like this:
```
MyAmazingMod.framework.zip
├─ MyAmazingMod/
│  ├─ manifest.json
│  ├─ ...
```

In essence, **zip the folder, not its contents**. Bundling multiple modules through multiple folders isn't recommended - you should use mod options (see [Manifest](Manifest.md)).

Alternative archive formats (including RAR and 7z) are supported, though ZIP is still usually the easiest for people to work with (and RAR is usually the worst). If your mod is big, though, distributing it as a 7z file is probably a good idea.
